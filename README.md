## Abstract (note for revision until no revision in final defense)
The Mechatronics Engineering Students of the Batangas State University - The National Engineering University had conducted previous studies related to exoskeleton development. From the study of Adia et. al. (2022), as a help on patients with stroke having difficulty on lower body movement, the proponents designed and simulated an exoskeleton robot using SOLIDWORKS and Simscape to show the conceptualization of the robot through its simulation. The project showed the typical walking pattern of an exoskeleton robot through a flat environment. One of the following limitations of Adiaâ€™s Project is that exoskeleton development is only done through simulations only and no prototype has been manufactured.

The main objective of this project is to develop the exoskeleton robot for lower-body rehabilitation. It will cover the analysis of the previous design of Adia et.al., and the design of the electrical and control systems of the exoskeleton using engineering design softwares and engineering. This can further define the struggles of the project from the conceptualization to completion. Hence, This proposes a proof of concept to continue the development of the exoskeleton. 

By the development of the exoskeleton, the following evaluation methods include indirect testing for the functionality of the components being used. By the completion of this prototype, this serves as a stepping stone for different national biomedical companies to develop exoskeleton in the realm of Assistive Robotics. Overall in the health industry to give opportunity for fellow patients to assist in walking again.
