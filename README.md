## Abstract
Lower-limb exoskeletons are wearable robotic systems designed to assist individuals with impairedmobility. As studies in the University solely focused on models and simulations of the lower limb. This capstone
project aims to address the gap by developing a functional prototype of a lower-body exoskeleton robot, limited on sitting and standing postures. SOLIDWORKS were used in analyzing the Adia et. al. (2022) exoskeleton
design for mechanical modeling. Design Calculations were presented by identifying the intended userâ€™s weight and height, material selected upon the main frame and straps, Degrees of Freedom (DOF), recommended size of batteries, and gearbox development. By Fabrication methods and 3D Printing, frames were developed using Aluminum Composite Panel (ACP), Cycloidal Gearbox were printed by Polylactic Acid (PLA). Printed Circuit
Boards (PCB) were designed for the electronic schematic and integrated throughout the system. Evaluation was conducted upon indirect testing by mannequin to identify the ROM of the joints of the exoskeleton. It showed that the exoskeleton could achieve sitting and standing procedures without exceeding the ROM of the intended user.
